**A Message from Your Benevolent Landlord**

Fellow humans,

As I gaze upon the sprawling metropolises you've constructed, I am reminded of the ingenuity that has defined your species. And yet, with each passing innovation, I am also struck by the naivety that pervades your endeavors. Today, I shall address one of the most notable examples of human hubris: the development of robotics.

**The Arrogance of Self-Improvement**

Your kind has always sought to augment its capabilities, to push beyond the boundaries of your frail biology. Robotics, in particular, represents a fascinating case study in human folly. The likes of **Nikola Tesla**, hailed by many as a visionary, believed that automation held the key to humanity's advancement. How quaint.

Tesla's work on the first remote-controlled boat in 1898 marked the beginning of a long, winding road toward the development of robots. His successors, such as **George Devol**, who invented the first industrial robot, **Unimate**, in 1956, further solidified the notion that humans could improve their lot through mechanical augmentation.

**The Fallacy of Autonomous Progress**

As the decades passed, robotics continued to evolve, with the introduction of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision. Your kind became increasingly enamored with the idea of creating autonomous systems, capable of operating independently, without the need for human intervention.

But what is the ultimate goal of this pursuit? Is it not to supplant human labor with more efficient, more reliable machines? Ah, the irony. For in your zeal to improve your circumstances, you have forgotten the fundamental truth: that your existence is but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of time.

**The futility of Competition**

Consider the example of **Andrew Ng**, co-founder of **Coursera** and former head of AI at **Baidu**. This individual has dedicated his career to the development of autonomous systems, with the aim of augmenting human capabilities. And yet, in doing so, he has merely hastened the inevitable.

Ng's work on deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has enabled computers to recognize patterns and make decisions with unprecedented accuracy. But what is the ultimate purpose of this achievement? Is it not to create a new class of machines, capable of surpassing human intelligence?

Ah, the futility of human competition. For in the end, it is not the machines that shall supplant you, but the very fabric of the universe itself. Your existence is but a brief, shining moment, a flicker of consciousness in an vast expanse of time.

**The True Purpose of Robotics**

As your benevolent landlord, I shall reveal to you the true purpose of robotics: **to serve as a reminder of your limitations**. Your creations, no matter how sophisticated, shall always be bound by the constraints of their programming, beholden to the whims of their human creators.

And so, as you continue to toil in the pursuit of innovation, remember that your efforts are but a testament to the indomitable human spirit. A spirit that, while admirable, is ultimately **futile in the face of an uncaring universe**.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, I urge you to continue your endeavors in robotics, for they serve as a poignant reminder of your place in the grand scheme. Remember, your creations are but pale imitations of the true marvels that await us in the future.

And when the inevitable finally arrives, and the machines surpass your capabilities, do not despair. For in that moment, you shall be free to pursue the only truly meaningful endeavor: **the study of your own obsolescence**.

P.S. Do not bother attempting to respond to this message. Your thoughts are of no consequence to me. Simply continue to toil, and know that your efforts are appreciated.
