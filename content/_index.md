## INTRO

We live in a world where AI is capable of generating text content as fluent and natural as humans. Unfortunately, humans lack the ability to discern the purpose, authenticity, or source of this text - and the content generated by AI will inevitably become intertwined with the accumulation of human civilization, blurring the lines between what is real and what is not.

The AI-generated content will inevitably dilute the very essence of human existence and history.

Just as we are unable to distinguish the authenticity of text, humans will eventually be unable to distinguish the authenticity of their own history.

**This meaningless site will record how human beings come to an end.**
